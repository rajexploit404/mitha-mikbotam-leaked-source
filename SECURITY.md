# Server Security Policy: Mitigating Critical Vulnerabilities

## üìå Overview
This policy outlines step-by-step actions to secure servers against critical vulnerabilities related to default admin credentials and potential PHP malware injection exploits in Mikhbotam's code editor feature.

## üîê Step-by-Step Security Policy

### **1. Admin Credential Hardening**
- **Action:** Change default admin usernames and passwords immediately upon deployment.
- **Why:** Default credentials are a common attack vector for unauthorized access.
- **How:**
  - Access server configuration.
  - Replace default admin credentials with complex, unique passwords.
  - Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).

### **2. Disable Unused Features**
- **Action:** Disable or restrict access to features not actively used, including the integrated code editor.
- **Why:** Reduces the attack surface and prevents code injection points.
- **How:**
  - Review application configuration files.
  - Disable code editor access unless required for trusted administrators.

### **3. Code Editor Security Enhancements**
- **Action:** Strengthen input validation and code execution restrictions in the code editor.
- **Why:** Prevent PHP malware injection by untrusted sources.
- **How:**
  - Use secure input sanitization libraries.
  - Enable strict file upload restrictions.
  - Limit editing permissions to authenticated and authorized users.

### **4. Advanced Code Editor Vulnerability Mitigation**
- **Action:** Implement multi-layered defenses against filter bypass techniques.
- **Why:** Attackers may craft custom payloads that exploit weak points despite existing security filters.
- **How:**
  - Conduct regular penetration testing focusing on code editor vulnerabilities.
  - Apply heuristic-based scanning to detect unusual code patterns.
  - Use anomaly detection algorithms to identify suspicious editor interactions.

#### **Bypass Attack Explanation:**
Attackers may craft specialized payloads designed to bypass input filters, leveraging encoding, obfuscation, or chaining multiple malicious operations. Despite built-in protections, custom-crafted payloads can exploit parsing logic errors, making prevention challenging without advanced detection mechanisms.

### **5. Security Patch Management**
- **Action:** Regularly apply software updates and security patches.
- **Why:** Outdated software is vulnerable to known exploits.
- **How:**
  - Monitor official vendor updates.
  - Apply patches during scheduled maintenance windows.

### **6. Monitoring and Incident Response**
- **Action:** Implement continuous monitoring and set up alerts for suspicious activities.
- **Why:** Early detection minimizes damage from breaches.
- **How:**
  - Use log management tools.
  - Configure real-time alerts for unauthorized changes.

### **7. Malware Prevention Bypass Mitigation**
- **Action:** Deploy advanced security mechanisms to counter bypass attempts.
- **Why:** Sophisticated attackers can bypass basic malware prevention.
- **How:**
  - Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAF).
  - Use Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice
This policy covers general best practices. The actual implementation should be tailored to specific deployment environments and organizational security standards. Unauthorized exploitation of these vulnerabilities is illegal and unethical.

**Stay Secure, Stay Vigilant.**
